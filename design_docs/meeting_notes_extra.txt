Hi Team,

Great job on the initial spec. I noticed a couple of missing fields that form the core contact info. 
Please ensure these are added to the final ETL implementation for the Salesforce -> Snowflake pipeline.

1. **Email Address**: We need to bring over the `PersonEmail` field. Map it to `PRIMARY_EMAIL` in the target. 
   *Transformation*: Please Ensure it is strictly lowercased.

2. **Phone Number**: The `Phone` field needs to be mapped to `CONTACT_PHONE`. 
   *Validation*: We need to strip out all non-numeric characters (dashes, parentheses) so it's just raw digits.

Also, just a heads up, the `BillingState` mapping discussed earlier is critical for the regional analytics dashboard, so double check the lookup logic there.

Thanks,
Architect
