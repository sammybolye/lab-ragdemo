      "Question: what is context engineering\n",
      "A fascinating topic!\n",
      "\n",
      "Context Engineering refers to the practice of designing, building, and maintaining systems that can adapt to different contexts or environments. A context can be defined as a specific situation, setting, or circumstance in which an individual or system operates. Contexts can be physical (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor), temporal (e.g., daytime vs. nighttime), social (e.g., with friends vs. alone), or even emotional (e.g., stressed vs. relaxed).\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of Context Engineering is to create systems that can recognize and respond effectively to different contexts, taking into account the varying needs, preferences, and behaviors of individuals within those contexts. This requires a deep understanding of human behavior, psychology, sociology, and technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some examples of Context Engineering include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Smart homes**: Systems that adjust lighting, temperature, and entertainment settings based on the time of day, occupancy, or user preferences.\n",
      "2. **Personalized healthcare**: Software that takes into account an individual's medical history, lifestyle, and environmental factors to provide tailored health advice and treatment plans.\n",
      "3. **Intelligent transportation systems**: Infrastructures that adapt traffic light timings, routing, and signage based on real-time data about road conditions, traffic patterns, and weather.\n",
      "4. **Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)**: Systems that can recognize and respond to different contexts, such as adjusting visual elements or audio feedback based on the user's location, proximity, or emotional state.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve Context Engineering, developers use various techniques, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Context-aware programming**: Writing code that considers multiple contextual factors.\n",
      "2. **Machine learning**: Training algorithms to learn patterns and adapt to new contexts.\n",
      "3. **Sensor integration**: Collecting data from various sensors (e.g., GPS, accelerometers, cameras) to understand the environment.\n",
      "4. **Human-computer interaction**: Designing interfaces that are intuitive and responsive to user behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "By applying Context Engineering principles, we can create more effective, efficient, and user-centered systems that improve our daily lives.\n"

It also highlights the difference between an LLM (Large Language Model) that guesses and one that provides fact-based, reliable, and contextually relevant answers.\n",

      "Page 13 (Document 3) further elaborates on the concept of context engineering by mentioning the importance of previous conversation history and other relevant information in maintaining contextual awareness. It also discusses query agents as the most advanced form of query augmentation, which combines AI-powered techniques to handle the entire query processing pipeline.\n",
